Welcome to **chatWithPDF**! This repository contains code for a chat application that utilizes LangChain, Streamlit, and the OpenAI Language Model (LLM) to facilitate conversations based on PDF content.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up a virtual environment and install project dependencies.

### Setting up Virtual Environment

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashwin3005/chatWithPDF
   cd your-projectchatWithPDF

   ```

**Create a virtual environment** (replace venv with your preferred virtual environment name):
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

**On Windows**:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**On macOS and Linux**:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Installing Dependencies**
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the project dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required packages specified in the requirements.txt file.

**Running the Sample**
You're all set! Now you can run the sample code. Here's how:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

You need OPENAI_API_KEY to run this.
